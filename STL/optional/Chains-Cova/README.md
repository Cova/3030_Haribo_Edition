Cable Chains for Haribo 3030

WORK IN PROGRESS - especially on the documentation side.  Also - the Rambo mount is still missing for the X-chain; all the parts for the bed chain should be here.

IMPORTANT: You will require a longer-than-stock heatbed power cable to use the under-bed chain.

IMPORTANT: The 'ExtruderChainArm.STL' for the back of the X carriage is designed to work with the Original MK2 X carriage - it will NOT fit on a MK2S X carriage.

X-Chain Requires:  1x Rambo Mount, 1x ExtruderChainArm.stl, 1x ExtruderEndLink.stl, Lots of ChainLink.stl

Bed Chain Requires: 1x BedChainFrameConnector.stl, 1x HeatbedConnector - Bottom.stl, 1x HeatbedConnector - Cover.stl, Lots of Chainlink.stl, and one of 10x_cable_clips.stl from the main project (you may have enough already).
